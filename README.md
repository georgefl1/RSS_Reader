# RSS_Reader

This is a simple app I made to learn more about Android app development.

It retrieves the RSS feed from reddit's r/moneymaking subreddit, parses it, and displays it in a RecyclerView.
Additionally, the app will take you to the given RSS article from within the app when you tap it in the RecyclerView.
